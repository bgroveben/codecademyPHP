## I am at: UNIT 3: CONTROL FLOW: SWITCH

You wanna play along, great! Make sure you have PHP installed on your machine. No, I won't tell you how.

In your terminal, type

=> php -S localhost:8000

Then, in your browser search bar enter

localhost:8000/filename.php

## Why PHP instead of JavaScript?

JavaScript generally runs in the browser, or client. This means it only really knows what's going on in your browser, plus whatever information it gets from the website(s) you're connecting to.

PHP runs on the server, aka the same computer as the website you're visiting. This means that it has access to all of the information and files on that machine. You can build custom HTML pages to send to your browser, handle cookies, and run tasks or perform calculations with data from that website.
